Fraud Email Detection with Explainable Machine Learning Using a Linear SVM and Generative AI

Phishing and fraudulent emails remain a cybersecurity threat, leading to stolen identities, severe financial damage, and widespread data breaches. This paper discusses the detection problem by proposing a hybrid AI model that uses a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with generative AI. The model was trained and validated on the Enron email archive alongside a Kaggle phishing dataset. The Linear SVM delivers strong feature-metric classification, while the generative module provides natural-language explanations by identifying suspicious phrases, patterns, and contextual cues within fraudulent emails. The model achieved an accuracy between 96.8% and 98.8%, with precision, recall, and F1 scores stabilised between 0.96 and 0.99. The metrics of the result confirm that the system can successfully separate phishing emails from authentic emails. Consequently, this research shows that using two different types of AI together makes email fraud detection stronger, and the same idea could be used in real systems to help reduce the growing danger of scam emails.
